I just got back to routine, it goes from day to day,
I've got this sneaky feeling, gets closer as we play,
After months and months of planning, hard work to hit the road,
No sense of "security" you get when you're at home,

[Chorus]
And just for you, there is a calendar, not just a need for the time
But just 'cause you're on my mind,
It's made of days, this simple calendar,

But it feels like years going by, where do I cry

I've rearranged my whole life, such things are hard for two,
But still the music keeps me going and my heart is set on you,
We see so many faces, do cities look the same,
I'll take this voyage anyway, and hope someday you'll go
